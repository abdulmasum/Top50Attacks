# Social Engineering Attack Analysis

## Rule of Thumb to Identify Social Engineering Attacks

1. **Unusual Requests**: Be cautious of unexpected requests for sensitive information or actions.
2. **Sense of Urgency**: Attackers often create a sense of urgency to prompt quick actions without proper verification.
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: Look for attempts to exploit emotions such as fear, curiosity, or greed.
4. **Impersonation**: Verify the identity of individuals claiming to be from trusted sources.
5. **Suspicious Links or Attachments**: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown or unverified sources.

## Indicators to Look For

- **Unusual Communication Patterns**: Emails or messages that deviate from normal communication patterns.
- **Mismatched URLs**: Links that do not match the legitimate website's URL.
- **Spelling and Grammar Errors**: Poorly written messages can be a sign of phishing attempts.
- **Requests for Confidential Information**: Unsolicited requests for passwords, account numbers, or other sensitive data.
- **Unexpected Attachments**: Attachments from unknown senders or unexpected sources.

## Analyzing Social Engineering Attacks Using SPL (Search Processing Language)

To analyze social engineering attacks using SPL in a tool like Splunk, you can use the following queries:

### Example 1: Identify Phishing Emails
```bash
index=email_logs sourcetype="email" 
| search subject="urgent" OR subject="important" 
| stats count by sender, recipient, subject
```

### Example 2: Detect Unusual Login Attempts
```bash
index=auth_logs sourcetype="authentication" 
| stats count by user, src_ip 
| where count > 5
```

### Example 3: Monitor Suspicious URL Clicks
```bash
index=web_logs sourcetype="web" 
| search url="*phishing*" 
| stats count by user, url
```

### Example 4: Track Unexpected Attachments
```bash
index=email_logs sourcetype="email" 
| search attachment="*.exe" OR attachment="*.zip" 
| stats count by sender, recipient, attachment
```

By using these queries, you can identify potential social engineering attacks and take appropriate actions to mitigate them.
