# Suspicious Cloud Storage Activities

## Rule of Thumb to Identify Suspicious Cloud Storage Attacks

When analyzing cloud storage activities for potential attacks, consider the following indicators:

1. **Unusual Access Patterns**: Look for access from unusual locations or at unusual times.
2. **Large Data Transfers**: Monitor for unexpected large data uploads or downloads.
3. **Multiple Failed Login Attempts**: Identify repeated failed login attempts which may indicate brute force attacks.
4. **New or Unrecognized Devices**: Check for access from devices that have not been previously used.
5. **Changes in Permissions**: Watch for unauthorized changes in user permissions or roles.
6. **Unusual File Activity**: Look for unusual file creation, modification, or deletion patterns.
7. **Anomalous User Behavior**: Monitor for users accessing data they don't typically use.

## Analyzing Suspicious Activities Using SPL (Search Processing Language)

To analyze these activities using SPL, you can use the following queries:

### 1. Unusual Access Patterns
```bash
index=cloud_storage sourcetype=access_logs
| stats count by user, src_ip, _time
| where count > threshold
```

### 2. Large Data Transfers
```bash
index=cloud_storage sourcetype=transfer_logs
| stats sum(bytes_transferred) by user, _time
| where sum(bytes_transferred) > threshold
```

### 3. Multiple Failed Login Attempts
```bash
index=cloud_storage sourcetype=auth_logs action=failure
| stats count by user, src_ip, _time
| where count > threshold
```

### 4. New or Unrecognized Devices
```bash
index=cloud_storage sourcetype=access_logs
| stats dc(device_id) by user
| where dc(device_id) > threshold
```

### 5. Changes in Permissions
```bash
index=cloud_storage sourcetype=permission_logs
| stats count by user, permission_change, _time
| where count > threshold
```

### 6. Unusual File Activity
```bash
index=cloud_storage sourcetype=file_activity_logs
| stats count by user, file_action, _time
| where count > threshold
```

### 7. Anomalous User Behavior
```bash
index=cloud_storage sourcetype=access_logs
| stats count by user, accessed_resource, _time
| where count > threshold
```

By monitoring these indicators and using the appropriate SPL queries, you can identify and analyze suspicious cloud storage activities effectively.
