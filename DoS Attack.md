# DoS Attack Analysis

## Rule of Thumb for DoS Attack
1. **Monitor Traffic Patterns**: Look for unusual spikes in traffic.
2. **Check Server Performance**: Identify any degradation in server performance.
3. **Analyze Logs**: Review logs for repeated requests from the same IP addresses.
4. **Network Monitoring**: Use network monitoring tools to detect abnormal traffic.
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive requests.

## Indicators to Look For
- **Unusual Traffic Spikes**: Sudden and sustained increase in traffic.
- **Repeated Requests**: Multiple requests from the same IP address.
- **High Bandwidth Usage**: Unexplained high bandwidth consumption.
- **Service Unavailability**: Frequent downtime or slow response times.
- **Error Messages**: Increase in error messages or failed requests.

## Analyzing DoS Attacks Using SPL (Search Processing Language)
```bash
index=network_traffic sourcetype=access_combined
| stats count by clientip
| where count > 1000
| table clientip count
```
```bash

index=network_traffic sourcetype=access_combined
| timechart span=1m count by clientip
| where count > 1000
```

```bash

index=network_traffic sourcetype=access_combined
| stats sum(bytes) as total_bytes by clientip
| where total_bytes > 1000000
| table clientip total_bytes
```
