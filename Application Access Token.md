# Application Access Token Analysis

## Rule of Thumb for Application Access Tokens
1. **Secure Storage**: Store tokens securely using environment variables or secure vaults.
2. **Minimal Scope**: Grant the least privilege necessary for the application to function.
3. **Expiration**: Ensure tokens have an expiration date and are rotated regularly.
4. **Revocation**: Implement a mechanism to revoke tokens if they are compromised.
5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Log token usage and monitor for unusual activity.

## Indicators to Look For
1. **Unusual Access Patterns**: Access from unexpected IP addresses or at unusual times.
2. **Failed Authentication Attempts**: Multiple failed attempts to use a token.
3. **High Volume of Requests**: An unusually high number of requests using the same token.
4. **Access to Sensitive Data**: Tokens accessing data they shouldn't have access to.
5. **Token Sharing**: Tokens being used by multiple users or systems.

## Analyzing Attacks Using SPL (Search Processing Language)
1. **Identify Unusual Access Patterns**
    ```spl
    index=access_logs sourcetype=access_combined
    | stats count by clientip
    | where count > threshold
    ```

2. **Detect Failed Authentication Attempts**
    ```spl
    index=auth_logs sourcetype=auth_combined
    | search "authentication failure"
    | stats count by user
    | where count > threshold
    ```

3. **Monitor High Volume of Requests**
    ```spl
    index=access_logs sourcetype=access_combined
    | stats count by token
    | where count > threshold
    ```

4. **Check Access to Sensitive Data**
    ```spl
    index=data_access_logs sourcetype=data_combined
    | search "sensitive_data_access"
    | stats count by token
    | where count > threshold
    ```

5. **Detect Token Sharing**
    ```spl
    index=access_logs sourcetype=access_combined
    | stats dc(clientip) by token
    | where dc(clientip) > 1
    ```

By following these guidelines and using SPL queries, you can effectively monitor and analyze application access tokens for potential security incidents.
