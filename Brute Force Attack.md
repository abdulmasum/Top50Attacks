## Brute Force Attack Analysis

As a cybersecurity analyst, it is crucial to understand the indicators of a brute force attack and how to analyze them using SPL (Search Processing Language). Here are some key points to consider:

### Rule of Thumb for Brute Force Attacks
1. **Unusual Login Attempts**: Multiple failed login attempts from a single IP address or user account.
2. **High Volume of Traffic**: Anomalous increase in traffic to authentication endpoints.
3. **Account Lockouts**: Frequent account lockouts due to repeated failed login attempts.
4. **Geographical Anomalies**: Login attempts from unusual or unexpected geographical locations.
5. **Time-based Patterns**: Login attempts occurring at odd hours or with high frequency over a short period.

### Indicators to Look For
- **Failed Login Attempts**: Monitor for a high number of failed login attempts.
- **Successful Logins After Failures**: Look for successful logins that occur after numerous failed attempts.
- **IP Address Patterns**: Identify patterns in IP addresses attempting to log in.
- **User Account Activity**: Track user accounts that show signs of brute force attempts.

### Analyzing Brute Force Attacks Using SPL
To analyze these attacks using SPL, you can use the following queries:

```bash
index=authentication sourcetype=login_attempts
| stats count by src_ip, user
| where count > threshold
```

```bash
index=authentication sourcetype=login_attempts
| stats count by user, status
| where status="failed" AND count > threshold
```

```bash
index=authentication sourcetype=login_attempts
| stats count by src_ip, geo_location
| where count > threshold
```

Replace `threshold` with an appropriate value based on your environment's baseline.

By monitoring these indicators and using SPL queries, you can effectively identify and analyze brute force attacks.
