# DNS Amplification Attack Analysis

## Rule of Thumb for DNS Amplification Attack
DNS Amplification attacks are a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack where an attacker exploits the functionality of open DNS resolvers to flood a target with a large amount of traffic. Here are some key indicators and steps to analyze these attacks:

### Indicators to Look For
1. **Unusual Traffic Patterns**: A significant increase in DNS traffic volume.
2. **Source IP Addresses**: Multiple requests from a single IP or a small set of IPs.
3. **Response Size**: Large DNS response sizes compared to the request size.
4. **Query Types**: A high number of ANY queries or other types that generate large responses.
5. **Destination Ports**: Traffic directed to port 53 (DNS).

### Analyzing DNS Amplification Attacks Using SPL (Search Processing Language)
To analyze DNS amplification attacks using SPL, you can use the following queries in your SIEM tool:

#### 1. Identify Unusual Traffic Patterns
```bash
index=dns_logs
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, query_type
| where count > threshold
```

#### 2. Detect Large DNS Responses
```bash
index=dns_logs
| eval response_size = len(_raw)
| where response_size > threshold
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, query_type, response_size
```

#### 3. Monitor for ANY Queries
```bash
index=dns_logs
| search query_type="ANY"
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip
| where count > threshold
```

#### 4. Identify Traffic to Port 53
```bash
index=network_logs
| search dest_port=53
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip
| where count > threshold
```

### Conclusion
By monitoring these indicators and using the provided SPL queries, you can effectively detect and analyze DNS amplification attacks. Regularly updating your thresholds based on normal traffic patterns is crucial for accurate detection.
