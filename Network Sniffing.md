# Network Sniffing Analysis

## Rule of Thumb for Network Sniffing
1. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Regularly monitor network traffic for unusual patterns.
2. **Use Encryption**: Ensure sensitive data is encrypted to prevent interception.
3. **Implement Network Segmentation**: Limit the spread of sniffing attacks by segmenting the network.
4. **Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Use IDS to detect and alert on suspicious activities.
5. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular network audits to identify vulnerabilities.

## Indicators to Look For
- **Unusual Traffic Patterns**: Sudden spikes in traffic or unusual data flows.
- **Unauthorized Devices**: Unknown devices connected to the network.
- **Frequent ARP Requests**: High volume of ARP requests may indicate ARP spoofing.
- **Duplicate IP Addresses**: Multiple devices with the same IP address.
- **Unusual Port Activity**: Unexpected open ports or services.

## Analyzing Attacks Using SPL (Search Processing Language)
### Example SPL Queries

1. **Detecting Unusual Traffic Patterns**
    ```bash
    index=network_traffic | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip | where count > threshold
    ```

2. **Identifying Unauthorized Devices**
    ```bash

    index=network_traffic | stats dc(mac_address) by ip_address | where dc(mac_address) > 1
    ```

3. **Monitoring ARP Requests**
    ```bash
    index=network_traffic sourcetype=arp | stats count by src_ip | where count > threshold
    ```

4. **Finding Duplicate IP Addresses**
    ```bash
    index=network_traffic | stats dc(mac_address) by ip_address | where dc(mac_address) > 1
    ```

5. **Checking Unusual Port Activity**
    ```bash
    index=network_traffic | stats count by dest_port | where count > threshold
    ```

By following these guidelines and using SPL queries, you can effectively analyze network sniffing attacks and enhance your network security posture.
