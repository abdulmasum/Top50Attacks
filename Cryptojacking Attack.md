# Cryptojacking Attack Analysis

## Rule of Thumb for Cryptojacking Attack

Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of someone else's computer to mine cryptocurrency. Here are some rules of thumb to identify and analyze cryptojacking attacks:

### Indicators to Look For:
1. **Performance Issues**: Unexplained slowdowns in system performance, high CPU usage, or overheating.
2. **Unusual Network Traffic**: Increased outbound traffic to unfamiliar IP addresses or domains.
3. **Unexpected Processes**: Unknown or suspicious processes running in the background.
4. **Browser Issues**: Browser extensions or scripts consuming high resources.
5. **Increased Power Consumption**: Devices consuming more power than usual.

### Analyzing Cryptojacking Attacks Using SPL (Search Processing Language):

To analyze cryptojacking attacks using SPL, you can use the following queries:

1. **Identify High CPU Usage**:
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=cpu_usage | stats avg(cpu) by host | where avg(cpu) > 80
    ```

2. **Detect Unusual Network Traffic**:
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=network_traffic | stats count by dest_ip | where count > 1000
    ```

3. **Find Suspicious Processes**:
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=processes | search process_name=*miner* OR process_name=*cryptonight* | stats count by host, process_name
    ```

4. **Monitor Browser Activity**:
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=browser_activity | stats avg(cpu) by url | where avg(cpu) > 50
    ```

5. **Check Power Consumption**:
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=power_usage | stats avg(power) by host | where avg(power) > threshold_value
    ```

By monitoring these indicators and using the above SPL queries, you can effectively detect and analyze cryptojacking attacks in your environment.
