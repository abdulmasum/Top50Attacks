# IoT Threats Analysis

## Rule of Thumb for IoT Threats
When analyzing IoT threats, consider the following indicators:
- Unusual network traffic patterns
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Unexpected device behavior
- Anomalies in device logs
- Communication with known malicious IP addresses
- Sudden changes in device firmware or software

## Indicators to Look For
1. **Network Traffic**: Monitor for unusual spikes or patterns in network traffic.
2. **Access Attempts**: Look for repeated failed login attempts or logins from unfamiliar locations.
3. **Device Behavior**: Identify any unexpected reboots, crashes, or changes in device performance.
4. **Logs**: Analyze logs for any anomalies or irregularities.
5. **Malicious IPs**: Check for communication with IP addresses known to be associated with malicious activity.
6. **Firmware/Software Changes**: Detect any unauthorized changes to device firmware or software.

## Analyzing Attacks Using SPL (Search Processing Language)
To analyze IoT attacks using SPL, you can use the following queries:

### Example SPL Queries
1. **Detecting Unusual Network Traffic**
    ```bash
    index=iot_logs sourcetype=network_traffic
    | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip
    | where count > threshold
    ```

2. **Identifying Unauthorized Access Attempts**
    ```bash
    index=iot_logs sourcetype=auth_logs
    | stats count by user, src_ip
    | where count > threshold AND user="unknown"
    ```

3. **Monitoring Device Behavior**
    ```bash
    index=iot_logs sourcetype=device_logs
    | stats count by device_id, event_type
    | where event_type="unexpected_reboot" OR event_type="crash"
    ```

4. **Analyzing Log Anomalies**
    ```bash
    index=iot_logs sourcetype=device_logs
    | stats count by log_level, message
    | where log_level="error" OR log_level="warning"
    ```

5. **Checking for Malicious IP Communication**
    ```bash
    index=iot_logs sourcetype=network_traffic
    | lookup malicious_ips.csv ip as dest_ip OUTPUT ip as malicious_ip
    | where isnotnull(malicious_ip)
    ```

6. **Detecting Firmware/Software Changes**
    ```bash
    index=iot_logs sourcetype=device_updates
    | stats count by device_id, update_type
    | where update_type="unauthorized"
    ```

By using these indicators and SPL queries, you can effectively analyze and respond to IoT threats.
