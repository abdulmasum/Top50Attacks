# Identifying and Analyzing Ransomware Attacks

## Rule of Thumb to Identify Ransomware Attacks

1. **Unusual File Extensions**: Look for files with unusual extensions or files that have been renamed with extensions like `.encrypted`, `.locked`, etc.
2. **Ransom Notes**: Check for ransom notes in directories, typically named `README.txt`, `DECRYPT_INSTRUCTIONS.html`, etc.
3. **System Performance Issues**: Monitor for sudden drops in system performance, which could indicate encryption processes running in the background.
4. **Unauthorized Access**: Look for signs of unauthorized access or changes in user permissions.
5. **Network Traffic**: Analyze network traffic for unusual patterns, such as large data transfers to external IP addresses.
6. **Disabled Security Tools**: Check if antivirus or other security tools have been disabled.

## Indicators to Look For

- **File Changes**: Sudden changes in file extensions or the presence of ransom notes.
- **Process Activity**: Unusual processes running on the system, especially those consuming high CPU or memory.
- **Network Activity**: Unusual outbound traffic, especially to known malicious IP addresses.
- **User Activity**: Unauthorized login attempts or changes in user permissions.
- **System Logs**: Errors or warnings in system logs that indicate tampering or unauthorized access.

## Analyzing Ransomware Attacks Using SPL (Search Processing Language)

### Example SPL Queries

1. **Detecting Unusual File Extensions**
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=filesystem | search file_extension IN ("encrypted", "locked", "crypt") | stats count by file_extension
    ```

2. **Finding Ransom Notes**
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=filesystem | search file_name IN ("README.txt", "DECRYPT_INSTRUCTIONS.html") | stats count by file_name
    ```

3. **Monitoring System Performance**
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=perfmon | timechart avg(cpu_load) by host
    ```

4. **Analyzing Network Traffic**
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=netflow | search dest_ip IN ("known_malicious_ip1", "known_malicious_ip2") | stats count by dest_ip
    ```

5. **Checking for Disabled Security Tools**
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=security_logs | search "antivirus disabled" OR "security tool disabled" | stats count by host
    ```

By following these guidelines and using the provided SPL queries, you can effectively identify and analyze ransomware attacks in your organization.
