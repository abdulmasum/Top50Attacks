# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack Analysis

## Rule of Thumb for XSS Attacks
1. **Input Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized.
2. **Output Encoding**: Encode data before rendering it on the web page.
3. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP to restrict sources of executable scripts.
4. **HTTPOnly and Secure Cookies**: Use these attributes to protect cookies from being accessed via JavaScript.

## Indicators to Look For
- Unexpected script tags in user inputs.
- Unusual URL parameters containing JavaScript code.
- Reports of unauthorized actions performed on behalf of users.
- Alerts from web application firewalls (WAF) indicating script injection attempts.

## Analyzing XSS Attacks Using SPL (Search Processing Language)
To analyze XSS attacks using SPL in a tool like Splunk, you can use the following queries:

### Example SPL Queries
```bash
# Search for script tags in HTTP requests
index=web_logs "script>"

# Identify suspicious URL parameters
index=web_logs url="*<script>*"

# Detect unauthorized actions performed by users
index=web_logs action="*unauthorized*"

# Alerts from WAF indicating script injection
index=waf_logs "XSS attack detected"
```

### Steps to Analyze
1. **Collect Logs**: Gather logs from web servers, WAFs, and other relevant sources.
2. **Search for Indicators**: Use the SPL queries to search for common XSS indicators.
3. **Investigate Alerts**: Review alerts and logs to identify the source and impact of the attack.
4. **Mitigate and Prevent**: Apply the rule of thumb practices to mitigate and prevent future XSS attacks.

By following these guidelines and using SPL queries, you can effectively analyze and respond to XSS attacks.
