# Drive-by Download Attack Analysis

## Rule of Thumb

A Drive-by Download Attack typically involves the unintentional download of malicious software to a user's device without their knowledge. Here are some key indicators to look for:

1. **Unexpected Downloads**: Files downloaded without user consent.
2. **Unusual Network Traffic**: Spikes in outbound traffic or connections to suspicious domains.
3. **Browser Exploits**: Exploitation of browser vulnerabilities.
4. **Malicious Redirects**: Redirects to malicious websites.
5. **Changes in System Behavior**: Slow performance, unexpected pop-ups, or new toolbars.

## Indicators to Look For

- **Unusual File Downloads**: Check for files downloaded without user interaction.
- **Network Traffic Anomalies**: Monitor for unusual traffic patterns or connections to known malicious IPs.
- **Browser Exploits**: Look for signs of browser vulnerabilities being exploited.
- **Redirects**: Identify any unexpected redirects to suspicious domains.
- **System Changes**: Monitor for changes in system performance or behavior.

## Analyzing Attacks Using SPL (Search Processing Language)

To analyze Drive-by Download Attacks using SPL, you can use the following queries:

### 1. Detecting Unusual Downloads
```bash
index=main sourcetype=access_combined (method=GET OR method=POST) 
| stats count by uri_path, user_agent 
| where count > threshold
```

### 2. Monitoring Network Traffic
```bash
index=network sourcetype=netflow 
| stats count by dest_ip, dest_port 
| where count > threshold
```

### 3. Identifying Browser Exploits
```bash
index=main sourcetype=web_proxy 
| search uri_path="*.exploit" OR uri_path="*.vuln"
| stats count by uri_path, user_agent
```

### 4. Detecting Malicious Redirects
```bash
index=main sourcetype=access_combined 
| search status=302 OR status=301 
| stats count by referer, uri
```

### 5. Monitoring System Changes
```bash
index=os sourcetype=system_logs 
| search "performance degradation" OR "unexpected pop-ups" OR "new toolbars"
| stats count by host, message
```

By using these SPL queries, you can effectively monitor and analyze potential Drive-by Download Attacks within your network.
