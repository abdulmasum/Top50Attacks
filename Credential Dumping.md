# Credential Dumping Attack Analysis

## Rule of Thumb for Credential Dumping Attack
Credential dumping is a technique used by attackers to obtain account login and password information from the operating system and software. Here are some general rules of thumb to detect and analyze credential dumping attacks:

1. **Monitor for Suspicious Processes**: Look for processes that are commonly associated with credential dumping tools (e.g., `lsass.exe`, `mimikatz.exe`).
2. **Check for Unusual Access Patterns**: Identify unusual access to sensitive files or directories where credentials are stored.
3. **Analyze Event Logs**: Review security event logs for signs of credential dumping activities, such as unexpected logon attempts or privilege escalation.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns or connections to known malicious IP addresses.
5. **File Integrity Monitoring**: Use file integrity monitoring to detect changes to critical system files and directories.

## Indicators to Look For
- Unusual process execution (e.g., `mimikatz.exe`, `procdump.exe`)
- Access to `lsass.exe` memory
- Unauthorized access to SAM, SYSTEM, or SECURITY registry hives
- High volume of authentication requests
- Suspicious network connections

## Analyzing Credential Dumping Attacks Using SPL (Search Processing Language)
To analyze credential dumping attacks using SPL, you can use the following queries in your SIEM tool:

### Example SPL Queries

1. **Detecting Mimikatz Execution**:
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=wineventlog EventCode=4688
    | where process_name="mimikatz.exe"
    ```

2. **Monitoring Access to LSASS Process**:
    ```bash

    index=main sourcetype=wineventlog EventCode=4656
    | where Object_Name="\\Device\\HarddiskVolumeX\\Windows\\System32\\lsass.exe"
    ```

3. **Detecting Unauthorized Registry Access**:
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=wineventlog EventCode=4657
    | where Object_Name IN ("SAM", "SYSTEM", "SECURITY")
    ```

4. **Identifying High Volume of Authentication Requests**:
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=wineventlog EventCode=4624
    | stats count by Account_Name
    | where count > threshold
    ```

5. **Suspicious Network Connections**:
    ```bash
    index=main sourcetype=netflow
    | where dest_ip IN (known_malicious_ips)
    ```

By using these rules and queries, you can effectively monitor and analyze potential credential dumping attacks in your environment.
